* Git and GitHub: A Basic Tutorial
** Introduction
Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project. The main benefits to this are collaboration and history tracking.
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling remote collaboration.

** Where Files Are Stored
   - *Local Files*:  
     Your working directory contains files you are actively editing.
     These are normal files on your computer, like =heap.java=, =TestFile.py=, etc.
   - *.git Repository*:  
     A hidden folder (`.git`) in your project directory where Git stores information about your project's history (commits, branches, etc.).
     You will /almost never/ interact with this folder directly.
     This is also known as your 'local repository'.
   - *GitHub Cloud Storage*:  
     A remote repository hosted on GitHub, which can sync with your `.git` repo for backup and collaboration.


   _NOTE:_ while the '.git' folder contains information about the content, history, revisions, and structure of the files in your project, it is useless without the files themselves.
   The way git actually works is it tracks /changes/, meaning that a file has to be present, with the content that Git (the program) /expects/ to be there in order for changes to properly apply. This sounds confusing, but it makes more sense once you use Git more often.

   The key takeaway is that you can cause problems if you forget to make sure that your files are properly updated before making a change. We'll go over this more in a bit.

** Basic Git Commands
   - *`git status`*
     Displays the state of your working directory and staging area.  
     Shows:
     - Tracked and untracked files.
     - Files staged for commit.

   - *`git add <file>`*
     Adds changes in a file to the staging area, preparing it for the next commit.
     - Interaction: Moves files from the working directory to the staging area.

     Files must be 'staged' in order for git to track them. If you create a new file and make changes to it, but forget to tell git to track that file, it will not be added to your repository.

   - *`git rm <file>`*
     Removes a file from the working directory and the staging area.
     - Interaction: Deletes a file locally and schedules the removal for the next commit.

     This will delete the actual file from your local file system, /AND/ remove the file from Git.

   - *`git rm --cached <file>`*
     Removes a file from the staging area

     This will /not/ delete the actual file from your local file system, it will /only/ remove the file from Git.

   - *`git commit -m "<message>"`*
     Saves the staged changes to the local `.git` repository with a descriptive message.
     - Interaction: Records a snapshot of the current staging area to the repository.

   - *`git push`*
     Sends your local commits to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
     - Interaction: Updates the GitHub repository with your changes from the local `.git` repository.

   - *`git pull`*
     Fetches and integrates changes from the remote repository into your local repository and working directory.
     - Interaction: Merges updates from GitHub into your local `.git` repository and working directory.

** How These Commands Interact with File Locations
   1. *Local Files to .git Repo*:  
      - Use `git add` to stage changes.  
      - Use `git commit` to save staged changes to the `.git` repository.
   2. *.git Repo to GitHub*:  
      - Use `git push` to upload commits to GitHub.
   3. *GitHub to Local*:  
      - Use `git pull` to fetch and merge updates from GitHub.

** Workflow Example
*** Create a git repo
      - This can be done online on Github.com
        
*** Clone the repo locally
      #+begin_export shell
      git clone https://github.com/{OWNERS_USERNAME}/{NAME_OF_REPO}.git

      # To clone this repo:
      git clone https://github.com/CSJ7701/COM212_Project.git
      #+end_export
      - This will create the project directory under your current working directory.

      #+begin_export shell
      PWD
      #+end_export
      #+RESULT: /home/test_user

      #+begin_export shell
      mkdir MyTestProject
      cd MyTestProject
      touch Test.txt
      echo "This is text that will go into Test.txt" > ./Test.txt
      #+end_export

*** Check its status with `git status`.
- After you create Test.txt and make a change to it, you should see something similar to this:
#+begin_export shell
git status
#+end_export
#+RESULTS:
: On branch main
: Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
: 
: Untracked files:
:   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
: 	Test.txt
: 
: no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

*** Stage it for commit using `git add <file>`.
#+begin_export shell
git add Test.txt
# To add all files in the current working directory, use 'git add .'
#+end_export

*** Commit the changes with a message using `git commit -m "<message>"`.
#+begin_export shell
git commit -m "Updated Test.txt"
#+end_export

*** If collaborators make changes on GitHub, use `git pull` to fetch and merge their updates.
- You should pull often.
- I usually pull once, before I begin working on something in a project, and then again before I push my changes
  #+begin_export shell
git pull
  #+end_export

*** Push your changes to GitHub using `git push`.
#+begin_export shell
git push
#+end_export

*** Admin Stuff
You will need to update your name and email on your local git setup.
Git will prompt you to do this when needed.

You will also need to use a 'token' instead of a password to log in.
When git prompts you to login, it will ask for a username and password - the password field is where you enter your 'token'.
I would recommend running the command =git config credential.helper store= so that you do not have to do this repeatedly, though this is not the most "secure" option.
Tokens can be created on your Github settings, under developer settings (left side, all the way down), and 'Personal Access Tokens'. If you are worried about security, setting a reasonable expiration date is a good idea.
