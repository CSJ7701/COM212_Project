## Program Overview
Upon running `main.java` in `src`, the user will be greeted with a command-line interface and prompted with an initial start-up "Welcome" scene, accompanied by the various functions that our program has to offer. 

## Menu Buttons
Below is a list of menu `Buttons`. Each button calls a function that interacts with the database, whether it be data manipulation, generic searching, or the like:

1. **Add Idea**
2. **Add Student**
3. **Search Students**
4. **Search Ideas**
5. **Get Best Idea**
6. **Exit** (This simply serves as a means of terminating the program.)

## How to Trigger a Function Call from the Menu Display
Each function is tied to a numeric value to assist the user in selecting the desired functionality. The user may enter an integer value (corresponding to the desired action) in the blank space trailing the green `"Enter your choice: "` prompt, which is displayed at the bottom of the menu.
