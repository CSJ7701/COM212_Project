* Project Overview
This system will manage student records and ideas for our 'think tank program'. Students will be paid to generate ideas, and these ideas will be curated, stored, and sold to solve major societal problems. The system must be efficient, user-friendly, visually appealing, and reliable.

* Functional Requirements
** Student Records
- Each record will store:
  - Last name
  - Email login name
  - Four-digit SSN (used as the primary key)
  - Four-digit student number
  - The last 10 ideas submitted by the student
  - Average rating of the last 10 ideas

- Features:
  1. Retrieve a student record by SSN in *O(1)* average time.
  2. Display last name, email, SSN, average idea score, and access to the last 10 ideas.
  3. Add new records.
  4. Modify last name and email for existing records.
  5. Delete student records.
  6. Add new ideas to a student’s record, automatically updating the last 10 ideas (FIFO).

** Ideas
- Each idea will have:
  - Unique idea number (auto-incremented starting from 1)
  - Submitter’s SSN
  - Short description (minimum 20 characters)
  - Rating (0–100)

- Features:
  1. Store a maximum of 511 ideas ready for sale, accessible as follows:
     - Retrieve the best idea in *O(1)* time.
     - Add or remove ideas from the pool in *O(log n)* time.
  2. Ensure student records maintain up to the last 10 ideas, even after ideas are removed from the sale pool.
  3. Maintain a separate list of all ideas ever entered:
     - Support search by idea number.
     - Support deletion of ideas from this list (without affecting other structures).

** Additional Features
- Retrieve a student’s email login name using their student number in *O(1)* average time.
- Print a list of students (number, name, SSN, average score) ordered by student number in *O(n)* time.
- Save all data to persistent storage and reload it on startup.

* Extra Credit (+5)
- Maintain a comprehensive list of all submitted ideas.
- Search and delete ideas from this list without affecting other data structures.

* Technical Requirements
- Data must persist between system restarts using serialization or text files.
- The system must handle data efficiently and ensure correctness across operations.
